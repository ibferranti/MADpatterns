  "body": "# MADpatterns\r\n\r\n##Description\r\n\r\n**MADpatterns** is a tool to **M**odel and **A**nalyze  1**D** **patterns** using the software MATLAB, that was developed in the lab of Prof. Nancy Kleckner at Harvard University\r\nhttp://projects.iq.harvard.edu/kleckner_lab\r\n\r\n####Key Features\r\n\r\n1. Quantitatively model 1D patterning events based on the Beam-Film model for crack formation\r\n2. Automate analysis of 1D patterns\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\nDownload program, unzip the folder, open MATLAB and add the unzipped folder to the file path\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\nFor a detailed user guide and information on the relevance of this program to the study of meiotic recombination events, please read our manuscript currently available on bioRxiv and soon to be available in Methods in Molecular Biology.\r\n\r\ndoi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/083808\r\n\r\n##Credits\r\nThis program is a direct descendent of a previous program developed by Liangran Zhang, Nancy Kleckner and John Hutchinson:\r\n\r\nKleckner et al.
